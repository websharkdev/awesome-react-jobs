# Tactics

First, you need to determine your tactics by which you want to get the recruiter's attention. Imagine you're a recruiter looking for a developer like you, but remember there are thousands like you.

How would you try to get a recruiter's attention?

- create \ use a catchy LinkedIn account. Such an account should be created like this
- - a good profile picture
- - splash screen should reflect you and your style
- - The headline should be such that it tells everything about you (the first 45 characters are the most important). Do not use gradations (Junior, Middle, Senior) every company has its own gradations. I recommend that you include the main “key” words that explain who you are and why you are you
