# Awesome-React-Jobs

Hi everyone! My name is Oleksii and I am currently working in a Spanish company as Senior Front-end Developer. It was very difficult for me to find a job, I used many tactics, tricks and so on..... and now I've been working in this company for about 8 months and I like it, I really do. But if I had known about these tactics before, I wouldn't have spent months looking for a job.
