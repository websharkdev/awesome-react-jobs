# Checklist for writing a resume

The highlighted article focuses on creating an effective resume with an emphasis on demonstrating the candidate's value to the employer. Key principles include:

1. **Target Position without Grade Specification**: It is recommended to mention only one desired position in the resume without specifying the level (e.g., Junior/Middle) to avoid confusion and demonstrate a clear understanding of professional goals.

2. **Separate Resume for Different Positions**: A separate resume should be created for each role. It is advisable to highlight one key position to avoid giving the impression of indecisiveness or a lack of understanding of preferences to potential employers.

3. **Conciseness**: The resume should fit within two pages. On sites like hh or LinkedIn, it's possible to create a longer resume, but it's better to maintain brevity for ease of perception.

4. **Structured Information**: It is recommended to structure the resume into meaningful blocks: work experience, skills, education, contacts, "about me."

5. **Description of Work Experience**: It is important to present work experience clearly and concisely, indicating the essence of projects, responsibilities, and achieved results. Correct dates of employment should be provided for each position.

6. **Focus on Essence**: Job titles and descriptions should reflect the essence of the work, rather than simply duplicating information from employment records or contracts.

7. **Non-Profile Experience and Pet Projects**: If you don't have experience in a specific field, you can highlight non-profile experience or pet projects, emphasizing their relevance to new tasks.

8. **Photograph**: It is recommended to insert a neutral photo with a clear image of the face.

9. **"About Me" Section**: This section should briefly describe your value as a specialist and what you can offer the company. You can also add information about professional goals or education.

10. **Contact Information**: Convenient communication methods should be clearly indicated, for example, in the "about me" section.

11. **Age**: If age could be a barrier, it can be omitted.

The general rule is that the resume should be clear and concise to maximize employer interest.
